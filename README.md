# Character Generator

The DnD Character Generator is made in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Description

To use the generator, the user hits the button that says "Generate" and the details of a character will load. The only parts that are chosen for the user are the Race, Class, and Ability Scores. The program does the math for the hit points as well.
